# QA pTx package
> Quality Assurance package for UHF MRI pTx coils

## Short description

The QA pTx package contains a custom B1+ map sequence (based on tfl_rfmap) to map individual channels of a pTx coil. A QA assessment is performed based on a reference acquisition to detect trends or abnormal situation of the transmit elements. It also contains a scatterring matrix acquisition and follow-up. All results are immediatelly displayed in DICOM images. Graphs showing results of consecutive QA are automatically created for an easy follow-up of the pTx coil performance.
