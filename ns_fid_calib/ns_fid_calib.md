# ns_fid_calib package
> Voltage calibration for X-nucleus

## Short description
The ns_fid_calib package contains a modified fid sequence and a custom ICE reconstruction to acquire and assess reference voltage based on several fid measurements at different voltages. The signal is fitted to extract a reference voltage. This package is well suited for X-nuclei experiments for which there are no automatic voltage calibration.

## Information

- Softawre versions: VB17, VE11C, VE11E, VE12U-AP01, VE12U-SP01, VE12U-AP04

- Accessing the package: either using the Siemens C2P platform (https://webclient.eu.api.teamplay.siemens.com/#/c2p) or using a classic Siemens C2P paperwork.


- For a detailed description of the package, see the [ns_fid_calib package documentation](https://github.com/FranckMauconduit/MRI-packages-siemens/blob/main/ns_fid_calib/ns_fid_calib_documentation.pdf)
