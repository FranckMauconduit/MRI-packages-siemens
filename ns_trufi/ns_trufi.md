# ns_trufi sequence
> A X-nuclei enabled trufi sequence

## Short description
The ns_trufi sequence is based on Siemens product trufi sequence on which X-nuclei acquisitions are enabled. Several standard parameter limits are modified to fit specific requirements for x-nuclei acquisitions.

## Information

- Softawre versions: VB17, VE11C, VE11E, VE12U-AP01, VE12U-SP01, VE12U-AP04, XA20
