# AFI package
> Actual flip angle (AFI) package

## Short description
The AFI package contains a custom sequence to acquire B1+ maps in single transmit or combined mode. It also supports acquisition of a B0 map using 3 echoes during the short TR. All reconstruction are performed online using custom ICE programs and B0/B1+ maps are available at the console.

## Information

- Softawre versions: VB17, VE11C, VE11E, VE12U-AP01, VE12U-SP01, VE12U-AP04, XA20

- Accessing the package: either using the Siemens C2P platform (https://webclient.eu.api.teamplay.siemens.com/#/c2p) or using a classic Siemens C2P paperwork.

- For a detailed description of the package, see the [AFI package documentation](https://github.com/FranckMauconduit/MRI-packages-siemens/blob/main/AFI-package/AFI_documentation.pdf)
