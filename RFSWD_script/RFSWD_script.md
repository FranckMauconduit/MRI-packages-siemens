## Short description

The script extracts some of the information in the RFSWDHistoryListNew.log file on the MR system. It helps to find out the levels of SAR of a sequence and/or the limits that was reached when a sequence aborts or does not run at all.

## Information

- Softawre versions: All VE12U baselines. The script has been written and tested for VE12U UHF pTx systems (7T and above). It could be used as a baseline for other systems as well.
